## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`ipynb` file) that implements a predictive model to determine whether a placement will occur based on 100 input features of CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and IQ scores. The model is developed using Python and various libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, MLxtend, and Pickle. Logistic Regression classification algorithm is employed for building the predictive model.

## Installation
To run the notebook locally, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook (`Placement_Predictor.ipynb`).
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
5. Experiment with different parameters and settings as needed.
6. Save the trained model using Pickle for future use.
